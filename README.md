## Project Description

#### Welcome to Team Pura Vida's Wine Review Analysis for the [RMOTR](https://rmotr.com/) Data Science Coursework.  

I will be using common DS Techniques to explore a dataset of Wine Reviews that I found on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews). 

Started: 2.17.19

Completed: 3.17.19

### Project Vision Statement: 

To use Python and Data Science skills to elegantly interpret a dataset in a complete analysis project.

## Inspiration & Scientific Method

As an epicurean who has been involved in the Food Industry my entire career, I wanted this project to be related to a culinary dataset of some kind.  The wine review dataset caught my attention because I always had been suspicious of quality and price being directly related in the consumer's mind.  
I think that this dataset offers some great opportunities for sentiment analysis and other text related predictive models. My overall goal is to create a model that can identify the variety, winery, and location of a wine based on a description. If anyone has any ideas, breakthroughs, or other interesting insights/models please post them.


## Project goals

1. Import and inspect the dataset using ```pandas```.
2. Analyze the dataset using ```pandas``` and ```numpy```.
3. Create visualizations using ```matplotlib``` and ```seaborn```.
4. Interpret meanings from the data using the ```Scientific Method``` ("Data Science!").


## Project Stack
Python has a rich Data Science functionality that has been motivated by teams of scientists and engineers trying to solve scientific and engineering problems.  Python's Object Oriented Design, ease of syntax, and available libraries make it the industry standard for Data Analysis.  A 2016 study done by [O'Reily](https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/files/2016-data-science-salary-survey.pdf) shows that ```Python``` is now dominant over ```R``` throughout the Data Science community, favoring ```Python 3.6``` to the soon to be extinct ```Python 2.7```.  


```Python``` has become the fastest growing programming language of 2019, and continues to remain the industry standard for modeling and analysis in the scientific and engineering industries.  The Scientific Python Stack is an array of technologies that make Python so powerful for Data analysis and statistical prediction.

### Let's take a quick tour of the Scientific Python (SciPy) stack I used for the Wine Review Analysis:


### Language
- Python 3.6 (replacing legacy Python 2.7 in 2020)
- Cython (a speedy C library for backing up numpy)


### Scientific & Numeric Power
- SciPy
- NumPy
- SciKitLearn


### Interactive Environment
- Anaconda IDE
- IPython Notebooks
- GitHub (version control)
- RMOTR Notebooks


### Data Science Libraries
- Analysis tools
    - NumPy
    - Pandas
    - Cython
- Visualization tools
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn
    - Bokeh

## Dataset Overview


The data was scraped from [Wine Enthusiast Magazine](https://www.winemag.com/) during the week of June 15th, 2017.

This dataset is 150,930 Wine Reviews in one csv file of about 50 MB:

```winemag-data_first150k.csv```contains 10 columns and 150k+ rows of Wine Reviews scraped from WineEnthusiast during June of 2017.


Each record in the dataset represents a single wine review from an online user of [Wine Enthusiast Magazine](https://www.winemag.com/)

The following is a brief summary of the 10 different columns of data included in ```winemag-data_first150k.csv```:

## Data Columns

1. Country  - The country of origin of the wine.

2. Description - The description of the wine's flavor profile.

3. Designation - The vineyard where the wine's grapes are sourced.

4. Points - The number of points Wine Enthusiast  Magazine rated the wine on a scale of 1-100.

5. Price - The cost for a single bottle of the wine.

6. Province - The province or state that the wine is from.

7. Region 1 - The wine growing area in a province or state (for example, Napa Valley in California).

8. Region 2 - (Optional) A more specific region in a wine growing area (for example, Rutherford inside Napa Valley).

9. Variety - The type of grapes used to make the wine (for example, Pinot Noir).

10. Winery - The winery that made the wine.


## Dependencies
To get everything running, use ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
